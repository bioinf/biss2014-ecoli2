Найдено несколько токсинов, которые есть у нашего штамма, но нет у референсного генома. 

1) ShET2 enterotoxin
  Шиготоксин, который встречается у шигелл и эшерихий.
  
2) Small toxic polypeptide LdrD
Toxic peptide whose overexpression causes rapid cell killing and nucleoid condensation of the host cell. Overexpression induces
stress-response and a number of membrane protein genes.

ID UniProt = Q6BF25

3) Toxin PezT
Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Phosphorylates UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UNAG) on the 3'-hydroxyl group of
the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine moiety, yielding UNAG-3P. UNAG-3P inhibits MurA, the first committed step in cell wall synthesis, which
is then blocked. Upon expression in E.coli results in decreased cell growth and viability, followed 3 hours later by growth
restoration; the toxic effect and phosphorylation of UNAG are neutralized by coexpression with cognate antitoxin PezA.
A mutant lacking the last 11 residues is stably maintained in E.coli, unlike the wild-type which undergoes spontaneous mutation.
Expression of the deletion mutant in rapidly growing liquid cultures leads to cell bulging, permeabilization and massive lysis 
by 1 hour. Cells that survive are not able to undergo cytokinesis. Expression in slowly growing cells leads to bulging but not lysis.

4) Toxin HigB-2

Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Inhibits translation by cleavage of mRNA. Ref.2
Induction	
Induced by amino acid starvation and the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol. Ref.2
Miscellaneous	
HigB-2/HigA-2 has been shown to stabilize plasmids very efficiently in E.coli. Three hours of ectopic expression of higB-2 results
in bacteriostasis without any detectable loss of viability.
